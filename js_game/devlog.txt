DAY 1 (12/21/25) - Learn JavaScript:

- Got user input and printed what key was pressed
- Learned about objects
- Made a player object

- Drew a useless white border
- Drew another block, but this time it is yellow :)
- Learned how to detect when 2 objects collide, though currently only prints "COLLISION DETECTED"
- Learned how to actually collide
- Drew yet another block that is green
- Made collision system universal
- Made it collect and remove green block, the temporary collectible, when collided with
- Hey.. guess what I just did... yup I drew block, but orange this time [insert ANOTHER ONE meme]
- Made the orange block the enemy and made it always follow the player
- ERROR: If caps is on, you can't moved
- If collide with the enemy, he respawns back to his original spawn point
- Added a health variable to the player object, setting it to 5
- If player collides with enemy, health decreases by 1
- Made the "Hello world!" text now write out player health
- Made the jump scare effect when colliding with the enemy

DAY 2 (12/22/25) - Put sum art in this bih:
- Added a name property and created a bunch of collectible objects in the collectibles array
- Learned how to concatenate strings
- Rather than just printing "Collected!", it now prints "Collected: ", followed by the item name
- Created a scenes list that holds the menu and game scenes
- Created currentScene variable that will track the current scene obviously
- Created a startButton object
- Created drawButton function
- Researched a bunch of other stuff and made a bunch of other functions, and FINALLY I have TWO scenes, GAME and MENU, that are fully FUNCTIONAL!
- Created lose scene
- If player.health <= 0, switches to lose scene
- After about 45 GOSH DARN MINUTES I finally have a lighting system in place, drawing a black rectangle and then a whole that shows the player, giving a darkness effect to the game :)
- Made a camera that follows the player
- Using jumpscare code as reference, I was able to make the pulse system, but still need to add a cooldown, so the player can not spam it
- Added a simple && statement so the player can't have the pulse going non-stop, but they can still activate it as soon as it ends, so I still need to work on the cooldown even more
- Finished the pulse cooldown system -> 2 sec pulse ability with a 10 sec cooldown
- Created win scene that appears when all items have been collected by checking the player.items value that gets increased every time a collectible is picked up
- Created a controls scene, a controls button in the menu, and a menu button in the controls scene
- Made so when the pulse is activated, enemies come to a halt
- Drew Santa hat, Christmas tree, and candy cane collectibles, as well as elf player sprite
- Learned how to draw images on the screen
- Now draws the Santa hat, Christmas tree, and candy cane collectibles, as well as elf player sprite
- ERROR: Due to the images being drawn in a 32x32 box, it leaves extra padding causing for collisions to goof up
- Fixed the error by using Aseprite's trim feature to quickly trim the excess padding on all the images, bringing back the perfect collisions that the rect's had previously
- Drew stocking, cookies, and milk collectibles, and loaded them into the game
- Drew and added enemy sprite to the game
- Zoomed the camera in
- Fixed the images from looking blurry to looking clear and clean
- Learned that the camera system actually moves the world, so whatever is drawn after its restoration, can stay put, leading to it being easy to make the HUD system
- Made the HUD system that still is only tracking the player health

DAY 3 (12/23/25) - Technically still day 2...:
NOTE: Yeah it's 12am right now, been working on this a whole lot, so I could put this in day 2, but ima put it in day 3, as it did just turn to the 23rd, so yeah lol, back to work
- Added text to the HUD that displays "Pulse available" when well the pulse is available DUHH, but after it's been used, it displays the cooldown time

- Learned how to load sounds into the game, and implemented bell sound effect and winMusic

- Improved the Controls scene and added text to display the controls and goal of the game
- Added start button and menu button to the win scene so the player can return to menu or replay from there
- Added start button and menu button to lose scene as well
- ERROR: When the player clicks replay, it doesn't put everything back into place--collectibles, enemies, and player
- Added spawnX and spawnY to player object, 
- Created reset function and implemented it so all variables get reset to original when starting game scene
- Added baseSpeed property to the enemy objects
- Now as the player collects a item, each enemy speed SLIGHTLY increases using this formula: enemy.speed = enemy.baseSpeed + (player.items * 0.03);, leading to the game becoming progressively more difficult
