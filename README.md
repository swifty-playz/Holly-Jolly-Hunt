# Holly-Jolly-Hunt
Step into the dark Christmas night, collecting festive items. But beware, in the dark lays enemies of the night. Use your magical bell to temporarily paralyze them. Collect all the items to light up the night and win!

P.S. This was my first time using JavaScript, and I only worked on it for 3 days, not 7 days as the jam is intended for. So the programming might be bad and the art is terrible. But I learned a lot from this, and that's all that matters.
